[Tetrinet](http://tetrinet.info) is a cross-platform network-enabled Tetris multiplayer game that follows a simple client/server architecture. It is an easy-to-learn, fast, adictive network game. TetinetX is an opensource free implementation of the server that can be downloaded from http://tetrinetx.sourceforge.net

This Docker Image has been created as part of the [Global Azure Bootcamp 2017 - Spain, Madrid](http://azurebootcamp.es), with a fully functional container than can be leveraged in almost any x64 based Linux environment, whatever it is hosted in on-premises or in the cloud.

This Docker Image has the following features:

  * **Image size:** ~35 MB. Lightweight optimized environment provided by [Alpine GNU/Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/).
  * **[Tetrinetx](http://tetrinetx.sourceforge.net/) server version:** 1.13.16+qirc1.40, latest stable release available.
  * **[Tetristats](https://github.com/fcambus/tetristats)**. An HTML winlist generator, that is published via nginx server provided in the image.
  * **nginx**. Lightweight webserver for providing homepage, client download, instructions and winlist publishing.
  * **Exposed ports:** 31457/TCP (tetrinetx game server), 31458/TCP (tetrinetx spec server), 80/TCP (nginx web server).

The image is officially published at [https://hub.docker.com/r/cmilanf/tetrinetx/](https://hub.docker.com/r/cmilanf/tetrinetx/).

## DEPLOYING
This image can be launched successfully with the following syntax:
```bash
docker run -p 31457:31457 -p 31458:31458 -p 80:80 -d -h myhostname.com -e OP_PASSWORD=pass4word -e SPEC_PASSWORD=pass4word --name tetrix cmilanf/tetrinetx
```

  * **-p 31457:31457 -p 31458:31458 -p 80:80**. Exposure of the container ports to host machine. Feel free to change this redirection as long as you keep the original EXPOSE.
  * ** -d**. Daemonize, so we won't wait for any user input after launching the container.
  * **-h myhostname.com**. **REQUIRED** You have to enter here a FQDN in order for the server to work correctly. It doesn't matter if it doesn't match your actual DNS name.
  * ** -e OP_PASSWORD=pass4word**. Administrator password for the server.
  * ** -e SPEC_PASSWORD=pass4word**. Password for the spectator server.
  * **--name tetrix**. The name of the container.
  * **cmilanf/tetrinetx**. The name of the image you are deploying.

## USAGE
Upon successful launch, you can start using right away the server by pointing your [TetriNET client](http://tetrinet.info/download-clients) to the domain name or IP of your server.

A winlist of the running server will be published by HTTP, so you can use http://myserver.com form for public access. At container's first run, it will display NGINX welcome page. Each 15 minutes it will be updated with the latest winlist. It will look like this:
